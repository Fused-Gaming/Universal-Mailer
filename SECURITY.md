## Reporting a Vulnerability

**DO NOT** open public issues for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, please email security reports to: **security@fused.gg**

Include:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if any)

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 5 business days
- **Status Updates**: Every 7 days until resolved
- **Credit**: Security researchers will be credited (unless they prefer anonymity)

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Never commit .env files**
   - Contains passwords and secrets
   - Use .env.example as template

2. **Change default passwords**
   - Immediately after installation
   - Use strong, unique passwords

3. **Keep system updated**
   ```bash
   apt update && apt upgrade
   ```

4. **Review firewall rules**
   ```bash
   ufw status
   ```

5. **Monitor logs regularly**
   ```bash
   tail -f /var/log/mail.log
   tail -f /var/log/fail2ban.log
   ```

### For Contributors

1. **Never hardcode secrets**
   ```bash
   # ❌ WRONG
   DB_PASSWORD="mysecretpass"

   # ✅ CORRECT
   DB_PASSWORD="${DB_PASSWORD:-$(openssl rand -base64 32)}"
   ```

2. **Validate user input**
   ```bash
   if [[ ! "$DOMAIN" =~ ^[a-z0-9.-]+$ ]]; then
       log_error "Invalid domain format"
       exit 1
   fi
   ```

3. **Use secure defaults**
   - SSL/TLS enabled
   - Strong fail2ban settings
   - Minimal attack surface

4. **Run security scans**
   ```bash
   shellcheck build.sh
   # Check for hardcoded secrets
   ```

## Known Security Considerations

### SSL/TLS Certificates

- Let's Encrypt used by default
- Self-signed only for development
- Auto-renewal configured

### Firewall

- UFW configured by default
- Only necessary ports exposed
- SSH, HTTP, HTTPS, Mail ports

### Fail2ban

- Enabled by default
- 5 attempts, 1-hour ban
- Configurable via `.env`

### Passwords

- Auto-generated by default
- Uses `openssl rand -base64`
- Never logged

### File Permissions

Script ensures:
- Config files: 0640
- Private keys: 0600
- Scripts: 0755
